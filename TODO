An unsorted list of project ideas, in case I run out of things to do. Some of these will
inevitably be stale or already done.

* Make clicking the close button work

* Detect missing autoexec.n2o and do something even modestly useful

* Collect startup logs somehow

* Collect panics and other unhandled exceptions

* Collect crash dumps

* Draw regalia on planes
It's a bit embarrasing that this isn't already done.

* Flight dynamics model
How hard could this be? :scream:

* Figure out how high terrain is.
We fudged this with a good looking constant. Would be nice to have units on this.

* Shape exporter
We want to be able to load and show non-SH shapes, e.g. as an override for old and busted models.
Once we have that capability it is a reasonable jump to render to Janes SH files.

* How big are shapes?
Scaling by 4x works for runways, but other shapes appear to want some scaling, but not that much.
Others seem to want way more.

* Let there be light
Now that we have our buffers in a way that we can inject them wherever we need, we can access
the atmosphere parameters from the Terrain and Shape draw calls. We can use this data to light
those entities up properly so they're not just full-bright.
