=============
Mission Codes
=============

- Some of the (mostly) campaign missions have special codes for certain
  missions. The best known example is code u01 for the 1st campaign mission of
  the Ukraine campaign. When Yeltsin's aircraft receives damage, it broadcast
  "THIS IS AEROFLOT FLIGHT 261. EMERGENCY! EMERGENCY!".


- The line used in the mission is: "code u01", typically place between "view"
  and "sides" in the top section of the mission file.


- The file the code is actually located in is a ".MC" file, example: "U01.MC".
  These can be editted using a hex editor program.


- In order for the codes to work, certain conditions have to be met. In the case
  of code u01, the aircraft that broadcast the emergency must be: "alias -2" and
  the player's aircraft must be alias -12. When the aircraft takes damage from
  enemy fire, it'll play the broadcast.


- All items involved with the code must have the alias as listed below. The item
  does not have to be the same type as in the original mission. In default code
  u34, both items were Sacramento ships. In the now modified U3D, the first item
  became an aircraft carrier (WASHINGTON) and the second item became an air-
  craft (RAWHIDES). As each one receives damage, it sends its message and makes
  its broadcast.


- Many of the codes come with sound. Most are just a beep sound ( ^RADIOBP.5K )
  while some speak a message such as the AEROFLOT ( ^AEROFLT.5K ) broadcast in
  code u01 OR "BOGEYS, HIGH INBOUND FROM THE NORTHEAST" ( ^BOGEYHI.5K and
  ^FROMTHE.5K and ^NTHEAST.5K ) broadcast in code u07.
